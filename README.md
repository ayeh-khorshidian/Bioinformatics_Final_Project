# Bioinformatics Final Project - Functions and Regular Expressions

This repository contains solutions for various bioinformatics tasks including DNA sequence analysis, file handling, reverse complement checks, and population growth predictions.

## Task Overview

1. **Extract Exons and Introns**: Processes a DNA sequence to separate exons and intron regions and save them to separate files.
2. **Create FASTA Files**: Reads sequences and accession numbers, creating separate FASTA files for each sequence.
3. **Reverse Complement Check**: Verifies if two input DNA sequences are reverse complements.
4. **Population Growth Prediction**: Calculates the growth of a population over a number of days.
5. **Sorted Lines from User Input**: Accepts and sorts lines from user input.
6. **Sorted Lines with Count and Slice**: Similar to task 5, with count display and slicing.
7. **Sequence Length Analysis**: Analyzes sequence lengths and computes average.
8. **FASTA Sequence Analysis**: Provides options for DNA composition analysis and complement calculations.
